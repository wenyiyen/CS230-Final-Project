This repo contains the deep learning models to tackle 8 classification tasks raised by [PEER Hub ImageNet Challenge](https://apps.peer.berkeley.edu/phichallenge/detection-tasks/). For detail descriptions of please find the written [report](https://github.com/wenyiyen/CS230-Final-Project/blob/master/report.pdf) and [poster](https://github.com/wenyiyen/CS230-Final-Project/blob/master/poster_wyy_mfz.pdf).

## Overview of Classification Tasks
"PEER Hub ImageNet Challenge" is held by University of California at Berkeley. Totally 8 tasks are raised:
- Task 1: Scene level identification.
- Task 2: Damage state check.
- Task 3: Spalling condition check.
- Task 4: Material type identification.
- Task 5: Collapse check.
- Task 6: Component type identification.
- Task 7: Damage level detection.
- Task 8: Damage type detection.
